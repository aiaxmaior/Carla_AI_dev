# .gitignore Configuration Summary

## ‚úÖ Answer: YES, Large Files Are Protected!

Your `.gitignore` is configured to **EXCLUDE** all large files and directories automatically.

---

## What Gets Committed (Safe List)

### Directories:
- ‚úÖ `/Core/` - Your core system code
- ‚úÖ `/temp/` - Temporary development files  
- ‚úÖ `/custom_assets/` - Custom assets (filtered for large files)
- ‚úÖ `/Tools/` - Development tools
- ‚úÖ `/Utility/` - Utility scripts
- ‚úÖ `/configs/` - Configuration files

### Main Directory:
- ‚úÖ All your `.py` scripts (Main.py, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Configuration files (requirements.txt, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Documentation (README.md, *.md files)
- ‚úÖ Setup scripts (.sh files)

**Estimated Size:** ~100-500 MB (safe for GitHub)

## Critical Files That Are Protected

Your jetson/ folder contains **~40GB of files** including:

```
jetson/quantize/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct/  (~14GB)
jetson/quantize/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct/    (~14GB)
jetson/quantize/quants/                    (~12GB)
jetson/TensorRT-LLM/                       (~1.6GB)
jetson/cpp/                                (~200MB)
```

**All of these are EXCLUDED** by the `.gitignore` configuration.

## How to Verify Before Pushing

### Step 1: Initialize git (one time)
```bash
cd ~/qdrive_alpha
git init
```

### Step 2: Test what will be committed
```bash
# This will show what git would track
git add -n .

# Check the size
git add .
du -sh .git
```

### Step 3: Look for any large files
```bash
# List all files git will track
git ls-files | xargs du -h | sort -h | tail -20

# If you see any >50MB files, add them to .gitignore
```

---

## If You Need to Track Specific Files from Excluded Directories

Edit `.gitignore` and add exceptions:

```bash
# Example: Track a specific config from jetson/
!jetson/deployment_config.yaml

# Example: Track a specific small image
!images/logo.png
```

## GitHub Limits

| Size | Status |
|------|--------|
| < 1 GB total | ‚úÖ Ideal |
| 1-5 GB total | ‚ö†Ô∏è Works but slow |
| > 5 GB total | ‚ùå Not recommended |
| Any file > 100 MB | ‚ùå Blocked by GitHub |

**Your protected setup:** ~100-500 MB ‚úÖ

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# See what will be tracked
git status

# See what's ignored
git status --ignored

# See total size
du -sh .git

# Add everything except ignored
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Files Created for You

1. **`.gitignore`** - Main configuration (blocks 40GB+ of files)
2. **`check_large_files.sh`** - Pre-commit checker
3. **`GIT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete setup guide
4. **`GITIGNORE_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

---

**Bottom Line:** Your `.gitignore` is protecting you from accidentally committing ~40GB of model files. You're safe to run `git add .` and only your code will be tracked! üéâ
